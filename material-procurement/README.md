# Phase 2: Materials & Procurement

This phase documents the selection and acquisition of components used in building the vibration apparatus.

## Key Components Procured
- **Electric Motor** – for excitation and controlled vibration
- **Circuit Board** – for signal processing and control
- **Metal Stanchion & Frame Materials** – for structural support
- **Springs & Recording Drum** – for vibration capture

## Budgeting Strategy
We prioritized cost-efficiency and availability while ensuring mechanical compatibility and durability. Components were sourced locally and selected based on vibration tolerance, mounting ease, and integration potential.

- Custom PCB for control and signal routing (`pcb.jpeg`)

## Next Phase
We proceed to fabrication and integration, where these components are assembled into a working unit.
